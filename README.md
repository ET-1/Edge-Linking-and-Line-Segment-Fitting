# Edge-Linking-and-Line-Segment-Fitting

## Introduction
A Python version of Peter Kovesi's MATLAB and Octave functions for Computer Vision and Image Processing. This project only contains `<Edge Linking and Line Segment Fitting>` module. The thing I did is rewritting `<Edge Linking and Line Segment Fitting>` module in python.

## Usage
In `edgelink.py`, change your own input path and output path in `line #7` and `line #10` as comments directed.<br> 
If you are not using `<.jpg>` images as input. Then, change the extension in `line #21`.<br><br>
Finally, just run `edgelink.py` without parameters.<br>
